# Email Notification System - Complete Rebuild

## Overview
Successfully eliminated all existing email notification elements and rebuilt the email notification system from scratch with the exact messages specified.

## What Was Removed
- **Existing emailService.ts** - Completely removed
- **Email calls from swapService.ts** - Removed notifyNewMatch import and call
- **Email calls from chatService.ts** - Removed notifyNewMessage import and extensive debug code
- **Email calls from AddBook.tsx** - Removed notifyBookAvailability import and call
- **Firebase Functions email handlers** - Removed all complex email templates and logic
- **All email-related imports** - Cleaned up across all files

## New Implementation

### 1. Simple Email Service (`src/services/emailService.ts`)
Created a clean, minimal email service with exactly the specified messages:

```typescript
// 1. New match notification
export const notifyNewMatch = async (recipientEmail: string): Promise<boolean> => {
  return await sendEmailNotification(
    recipientEmail,
    'New Book Match',
    'You have a new book match.'
  );
};

// 2. Book availability notification  
export const notifyBookAvailability = async (recipientEmail: string): Promise<boolean> => {
  return await sendEmailNotification(
    recipientEmail,
    'Book Available',
    'A book you want is available.'
  );
};

// 3. New message notification
export const notifyNewMessage = async (recipientEmail: string): Promise<boolean> => {
  return await sendEmailNotification(
    recipientEmail,
    'New Message',
    'You have a new book swap message.'
  );
};
```

### 2. Firebase Functions (`functions/index.js`)
Implemented three automatic triggers:

#### New Match Notification
- **Trigger**: When `swap_requests` document is created
- **Function**: `sendNewMatchNotification`
- **Message**: "You have a new book match."
- **Recipient**: Book owner

#### Book Availability Notification
- **Trigger**: When `books` document is created
- **Function**: `sendBookAvailabilityNotification`
- **Message**: "A book you want is available."
- **Recipient**: Users who have the book in their wanted_books list

#### New Message Notification
- **Trigger**: When `messages` document is created
- **Function**: `sendNewMessageNotification`
- **Message**: "You have a new book swap message."
- **Recipient**: Message recipient (non-sender participant in chat)

## Key Features

### ✅ Exact Messages as Specified
1. **New match**: "You have a new book match."
2. **Book availability**: "A book you want is available."
3. **New message**: "You have a new book swap message."

### ✅ Fully Automated
- No manual integration required
- Firebase Functions trigger automatically on document creation
- Uses Firebase mail collection for email delivery
- Error handling included

### ✅ Clean Architecture
- Minimal code footprint
- No complex templates or HTML formatting
- Simple text messages as requested
- Automatic recipient detection

### ✅ Production Ready

- ✅ Email service integration points clean

## Deployment
- **Commit**: `d5c86e41`
