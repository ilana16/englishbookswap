# Notification Preferences Implementation

## âœ… Successfully Implemented

I have successfully implemented functional notification preferences that are controlled by the checkbox on the profile page. Users can now enable or disable email notifications, and the system will respect their preferences.

## ðŸ”§ What Was Implemented

### 1. Notification Helper Utility
Created `src/utils/notificationHelper.ts` with the following functions:
- **`getUserNotificationPreferences()`** - Retrieves user's notification settings from their profile
- **`getUserEmail()`** - Gets user's email address from their profile
- **`shouldSendNotification()`** - Checks if a user should receive a specific type of notification

### 2. Profile Page Integration
The existing profile page checkbox now:
- **Loads Current Preferences** - Displays the user's current notification setting
- **Saves Preferences** - Updates all notification types when the checkbox is changed
- **Persists Settings** - Stores preferences in the user's profile document

### 3. Service Integration
Updated all notification services to respect user preferences:

#### Chat Service (`src/services/chatService.ts`)
- **Before**: Sent notifications to hardcoded test email
- **After**: Checks recipient's notification preferences and email before sending

#### Swap Service (`src/services/swapService.ts`)
- **Before**: Sent notifications to hardcoded test email
- **After**: Checks book owner's notification preferences and email before sending

#### Add Book Page (`src/pages/AddBook.tsx`)
- **Before**: Sent notifications to hardcoded test email
- **After**: Finds users who want the book and checks each user's notification preferences

## ðŸŽ¯ How It Works

### Profile Page Checkbox
```typescript
// Loads user's current preference
setReceiveEmailNotifications(data.email_notifications?.new_messages ?? true);

// Saves all notification types when checkbox changes
email_notifications: {
  new_matches: receiveEmailNotifications,
  book_availability: receiveEmailNotifications,
  new_messages: receiveEmailNotifications,
}
```

### Notification Checking Process
1. **User Action Triggers Notification** (new message, book request, etc.)
2. **System Checks User Preferences** using `shouldSendNotification()`
3. **If Enabled**: Retrieves user's email and sends notification
4. **If Disabled**: Skips notification and logs the decision

### Notification Types Controlled
- **New Messages** - When someone sends a chat message
- **New Matches** - When someone requests to swap a book
- **Book Availability** - When a wanted book becomes available

## ðŸ”’ Data Structure

### Profile Document Structure
```typescript
{
  email_notifications: {
    new_matches: boolean,      // Controlled by profile checkbox
    book_availability: boolean, // Controlled by profile checkbox  
    new_messages: boolean      // Controlled by profile checkbox
  },
  email: string,              // User's email address
  // ... other profile fields
}
```

## ðŸš€ User Experience

### For Users Who Enable Notifications
- Receive email notifications for all activity types
- Can disable at any time from profile page
- Notifications include relevant details and links

### For Users Who Disable Notifications
- No email notifications are sent
- System logs that notifications were skipped
- Can re-enable at any time from profile page

### Profile Page Experience
- Single checkbox controls all notification types
- Clear label explains what notifications include
- Changes save immediately when profile is updated
- Current setting is loaded when page opens

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### Error Handling
- **Missing Email**: No notification sent if user has no email
- **Missing Preferences**: Defaults to notifications enabled
- **Service Failures**: Notification failures don't break core functionality

### Performance Optimizations
- **Batch Processing**: Multiple users checked efficiently for book availability
- **Early Exit**: Skips processing if notifications disabled
- **Async Processing**: Notifications don't block main operations

### Logging
- **Success Cases**: Logs when notifications are sent with recipient details
- **Skip Cases**: Logs when notifications are skipped due to preferences
- **Error Cases**: Logs errors without breaking functionality

## ðŸ“‹ Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: User Enables Notifications
1. User checks notification checkbox on profile page
2. User saves profile changes
3. When someone messages them â†’ Email notification sent
4. When someone requests their book â†’ Email notification sent
5. When a wanted book becomes available â†’ Email notification sent

### Scenario 2: User Disables Notifications
1. User unchecks notification checkbox on profile page
2. User saves profile changes
3. When someone messages them â†’ No email sent (logged as skipped)
4. When someone requests their book â†’ No email sent (logged as skipped)
5. When a wanted book becomes available â†’ No email sent (logged as skipped)

### Scenario 3: New User (Default Behavior)
1. New user creates profile
2. Notifications default to enabled
3. All notification types work normally
4. User can disable from profile page at any time

## ðŸ”„ Migration Notes

### Existing Users
- Users with existing profiles will have notifications enabled by default
- The checkbox will show as checked when they visit their profile
- They can disable notifications at any time

### New Users
- New profiles are created with notifications enabled
- All notification types are set to `true` by default
- Users can modify preferences immediately after account creation

## ðŸš€ Deployment Status

âœ… **Successfully implemented and ready for deployment:**
- Notification helper utility created
- All services updated to check preferences
- Profile page checkbox is fully functional
- Build tested successfully
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

## ðŸ“– Usage Instructions

### For Users
1. **To Enable Notifications**: Go to Profile page â†’ Check "I want to receive email notifications..." â†’ Save Changes
2. **To Disable Notifications**: Go to Profile page â†’ Uncheck "I want to receive email notifications..." â†’ Save Changes
3. **Current Setting**: The checkbox shows your current notification preference

### For Developers
1. **Adding New Notification Types**: Update `NotificationPreferences` interface in `notificationHelper.ts`
2. **Checking Preferences**: Use `shouldSendNotification(userId, notificationType)` before sending emails
3. **Default Behavior**: New users have all notifications enabled by default

The notification preferences system is now fully functional and provides users with complete control over their email notifications while maintaining backward compatibility with existing functionality.
